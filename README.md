# SAS Diet Data Analysis
Health Data Analysis via SAS is the final project for STA 402: Statistical Programming. In this project, we had to download a large dataset (over 1 GB!), convert it into a SAS format, perform data cleaning, then analyze the results using visualization tools in SAS. For my project, I downloaded information from the US CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey, which polls over 100,000 people about their health behaviors and risk factors. Using this, I checked to see if a person's diet (including fruit and veggie consumption, sodium consumption, etc.) would be a significant predictor of their physical and mental health. The results of my report and my code for cleaning and visualizing the data are included.
